1.HASHING: Rebalancing is needed when new server added.
2.But Rebalancing is problematic when number of node is not constant.
3.Consistent hashing reduces the rebalancing by 1/n % of total number of keys. (Motive is minimal number of rebalancing)
4.Consisting hashing works very well with virtual nodes concept.
